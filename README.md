## Goals 🎯
* Data visualization and exploration of a dataset.
* Dataset used is relative to speed dating.
* The objective is to understand what will influence the obtaining of a **second date**.

## Conclusion in short 📝
* A like and then a match (= willing to see the partner in a second date) is very unlikely to happen if there is no physical chemestry (attractiveness), no common interests (shared interest/hobbies) and no amusement (fun). 
* For more details and conclusions/key take away, see the notebook.
